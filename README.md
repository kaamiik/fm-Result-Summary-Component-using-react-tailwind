## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Accessibility
- Vite

### What I learned

This project was my first experience using React, and I chose Vite as the build tool to streamline the development process. It was a great opportunity to dive into component-based architecture, which helped me understand how to break down the UI into reusable pieces.

For styling, I utilized Tailwind CSS, which significantly sped up the design process with its utility-first approach. However, integrating Tailwind with React components presented some challenges, particularly in ensuring styles were applied correctly across different components.

Another key learning point was fetching and handling JSON data. I implemented asynchronous data fetching to dynamically populate the content, which was a valuable exercise in managing state and handling potential errors in a React application.
